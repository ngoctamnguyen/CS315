    <p><strong>Pho</strong> in Vietnam is one of the most famous dishes in the country. A classic noodle 
         dish, pho is considered the national dish of Vietnam. At the core, a Vietnam pho is 
         a noodle soup. A bowl of pho consists of a soup made of a clear beef or chicken broth 
         with flat rice noodles. </p>
    <p> Traditional pho in Vietnam is typically served in one of two ways.  There is beef pho or pho bo, which is beef noodle soup. And, there is pho ga, the chicken version. 
        <br>
         Due to the complexity in making the broth, most authentic eateries will serve one or the other, and not both versions of pho.
         <br>
         The meat selection for pho bo can be quite vast. For a more traditional pho experience, nam or beef flank and tái or slices of rare beef that cook in the broth are popular.
         <br>
         Well-done brisket or chín and beef meatballs or bò viên are also solid options.
         <br>
         Adventurous eaters can go for fatty brisket or gầu, tendon or gân and tripe or sách.
         <br>
         Typically, Vietnam pho comes in a small size known as nho or lon for a large bowl of pho. On the menu, Dac Biet is a “Special Pho” which is large in size and includes all cuts of beef.
