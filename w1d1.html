        <h1>Life story</h1>
        <p> I am Ngoc Tam Nguyen. In the daily day, I am always experienced my health, body, 
            and the way that I did in movement and working. I realized Iâ€™m a hot person, 
            a perfectionist, and like cool weather. My skin is sensitive, some time it easy 
            prone to breakout. When doing something, I always want to finish as soon as possible,
             he result must be perfect. After learning the lesion this morning, and take a quiz,
            the result is I might be a fiery, passionate Pitta dosha mind-body type. 
            This result once again helps me more understand my mind, my healthy and body.
            According to Ayurveda, when a person was born, they could not choose for them their
            own mind, health, body. It is combined of the five natural elements <i>(ether, air, fire, 
             water, and earth)</i>. So, I think I must well understand my health, my body. When learning
            <strong>Maharishi AyurVeda</strong>, I make the plan for me to balance my life: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The environmental, choose the cool place to live. The cool weather helps me feel better</li>
            <li>In my working: planning my work in a scientific way, without putting to much pressure, have a reasonable rest time</li>
            <li>Play sport as swimming, walking/running in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid directly sunshine.</li>
            <li>Drinking enough water in a day. Choose cooling fruits could make fresh and nutritious beverages. </li>
            <li>Doing TM in every day, at any time if I can. TM helps me release stress, calming down. Have a positive thinking</li>
        </ul>
